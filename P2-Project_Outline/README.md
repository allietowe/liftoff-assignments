## Submission Instructions

### Overview

In the past few years, I've become quite the plant hoarder. And in that time, I've perused plant apps in my downtime and always found them to be lacking. For beginners and experts alike. For my project, I want to create a plant app that will be useful for both. You will be able to track all of your plants. You'll have an inventory of your current collection, an area to upload photos of your plant to track the progress, as well as 'check for water' reminders that will be sent through text and take into account humidity levels and lighting environment. There would also be information on what plants look like when they need to be watered, and a page about identitying pests where users can upload photos of their own pest problems to help other users identify problems.

### Features

User Login: each user will make their own account and have authentication.
Create new plant in inventory: add each of the plants in your collection to your inventory.
Media Upload: Be able to upload photos of your plants to track progress.
Pest information: be able to read about each pest and see user submitted photos of each pest.
Watering reminders: be able to input when the last time you watered was, so that you can recieve reminders to check if it needs watered again.

### Technologies

C#
Angular
MySql
Twilio API
Treffle API

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll need to learn how to make it so users can upload photos. I also need learn how to integrate APIs into my application and combine Angular with C#.
